## Intro
<p> Creates a class using trees that can be used to store complex mathematical expressions. "Parents" are operators such as +, -, x, /, etc., while the "children" are the numbers involved in said expression. Thus the equation "2 + 3" would have a + symbol at the head of the tree, with 2 and 3 as it's children
  
  ## Other features
  * The expression tree class has many functions to help use these trees. One can easily build, add to, and solve the expression
  * The tree can also easily print out the expression in a variety of formats
  * For more details on functions, see express.h
