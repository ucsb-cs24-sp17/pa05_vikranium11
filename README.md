## Intro
<p> Expression tree class that can be used to store complex equations. "Parents" are operators such as +, -, x, /, etc., while the "children" are the numbers involved in said expression. Thus the equation "2 + 3" would have a + symbol at the head of the tree, with 2 and 3 as it's children
  
  ## Other features
  * The expression tree class has many functions to help use these trees. One can easily build, add to, and solve equations using the expression tree
